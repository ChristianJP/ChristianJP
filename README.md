“Information is the resolution of uncertainty.” – C.E. Shannon


Model the noise right, and meaning emerges.

🧠 Profile

Machine learning researcher focused on probabilistic modeling, adaptive inference, and signal classification. My work sits at the intersection of Bayesian simulation, generative systems, and sensor fusion, applied to real-world trajectory and signal data. Exploring Generative Modelling, AI and belief propagation. Building tools for perception.
